# minesweeper
I made Minesweeper using Java!

# Description
This is my implementation of the game [Minesweeper](https://minesweeper.online/) using entirely Java. 
This was a pair-programming assignment for my class CS2510. 

In this project, my partner and I made the game from scratch using ArrayLists, Iterators, and Java impworld library. 

# How to Set Up
Since this project was developed using a library made by my university, they must be installed and set up correctly for the game to work. You can choose whichever IDE you want to run it from, but I would recommend using Eclipse since the project was written in Eclipse. (IntelliJ IDEA for Java always but we gotta respect the OG) ðŸ«¡
