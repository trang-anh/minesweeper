# Minesweeper
I made Minesweeper using Java for my class!

# Description
This is my implementation of the game [Minesweeper](https://minesweeper.online/) using entirely Java. 
This was a pair-programming assignment for my class CS2510. 

In this project, my partner and I made the game from scratch using ArrayLists, Iterators, and Java impworld library. 

# How to Set Up
Since this project was developed using a library made by my university, they must be installed and set up correctly for the game to work. You can choose whichever IDE you want to run it from, but I would recommend using Eclipse since the project was written in Eclipse. (IntelliJ IDEA for Java always but we gotta respect the OG) ðŸ«¡

## Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure JDK 11 is installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).
External Library: This project depends on a custom library provided by CS2510 Fundies 2 team. You need to import the required JAR files to run the project. The library can be found in the EclipseJars folder.

### Eclipse
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open Eclipse and select File > Open Projects from File System....
3. Browse to the directory where you cloned or extracted the project and import it.
4. Add the external JARs:
5. Right-click the project in the Package Explorer.
6. Select Build Path > Configure Build Path.
7. Go to the Libraries tab and click Add External JARs....
8. Browse to the lib folder and select the required JAR files.
9. Apply the changes and run the project:
10. Right-click the project and select Run As > Java Application.
